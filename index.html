                <p>“This is an inspiring story! Fyaz gives an utterly compelling account of his journey from Islam to Christianity. It is a tragedy that what should be an entirely free and uncontroversial choice has resulted in the loss of his family and exclusion from the Pakistani community. To be an ‘apostate’ is to be shunned, persecuted and even violently attacked. Fyaz highlights the difficulties that face those who convert" <strong>(Lord Carey, former Archbishop of Canterbury)</strong></p>

                <h2>My Human Right to Leave Islam</h2>
                <p>I call upon the UK government to review existing police and local authority policies, procedures and officers' training in regards to victims of honour violence against ex-Muslims, and to help Dostana Ministries set up a hotline to record data on hate crimes against former Muslims by Muslims. It is time for the government to take action to protect the religious freedom of those who want to leave Islam. <a href="https://www.jihadwatch.org/2016/11/muslim-persecution-forces-convert-from-islam-to-christianity-to-flee-home-under-armed-guard-in-the-uk" class="underlinelink">Ex-Muslims like Nissar Hussain should not have to go into hiding in the UK</a>.</p>
