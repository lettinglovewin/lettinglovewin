                <p>“This is an inspiring story! Fyaz gives an utterly compelling account of his journey from Islam to Christianity. It is a tragedy that what should be an entirely free and uncontroversial choice has resulted in the loss of his family and exclusion from the Pakistani community. To be an ‘apostate’ is to be shunned, persecuted and even violently attacked. Fyaz highlights the difficulties that face those who convert but, in spite of this, he bravely demonstrates much practical love and care for the Muslim community. In particular, he calls upon the church to evangelise sensitively and lovingly among Muslims in Britain."</p>

                <p>“There is much to learn from this illuminating and moving account of the life of Mohammed Fyaz, a child born to Pakistani immigrants. The vivid description of his home life and the abuse he suffered, both in and outside that home, lingers; but the importance of the book lies in its ability to make us realize that we must not let our current fears destroy the progress we have made towards multicultural harmony. Indeed, Fyaz shows us how to reach out to the Muslim community, despite being rejected by his family and community as a result of his conversion to Christianity. Also, his experience as an apostate from Islam demonstrates how much attitudes and policies need to change in this country: most significantly, his story highlights the dangers he will continue to face in the UK, until our Government ensures that every citizen has the right, without intimidation or danger, to practice freedom of thought, conscience and religion as laid out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Act."</p>

               <p>“A fascinating book that traces Fyaz’s Muslim background and then covers the tensions within his Pakistani family, his subsequent disillusionment with Islam and struggles with the pressures of life in the UK. The book brings out the ups and downs of his life, even after becoming a follower of Christ. As he himself says, ‘my life was like a construction site. God needed to clear away so much rubble’. This took time, but despite opposition to his faith, it is a record of how the Lord did not abandon him, but rather preserved him and how God began gradually to transform his life."</p>

               <p>“This honest, harrowing autobiography, exposing the dysfunctional world of one Pakistani ‘kid’ growing up in the north of England, is an important contribution to our understanding of Muslims in our midst. Because it is written from the inside, desperate realities are not softened by awkward efforts to be politically correct. Nevertheless, at its conclusion, the author tells how he came to the decision to live, and keep living, for Christ. The lesson for those wondering how Muslims come to personal belief in Jesus as Lord is that the faith journey can be messy, may draw little on doctrinal discussion, and is mostly down to a gracious God who relentlessly seeks and saves the lost. The book does not deal in theory, but takes the reader through life lived in the raw on the other side of the road. Fyaz’s personal story carries a powerful reminder that it is individual people rather than typical examples of a faith community who, desperate to find a place and meaning in this world, live out that struggle. Its publication is a timely challenge to mindless stereotyping and a needed stimulus to continue seeking to build authentic relationships across religious divides."</p>

               <p>“Fyaz has written a powerful and moving account of his extraordinary journey from Islam to Christianity. He exposes the kind of pressures, and extreme rejection that former Muslims can face from their community. In the end love wins. His experience has led him to become a tireless campaigner for the freedom for Muslims to change their religion. This book should be read by anyone who longs to see Muslims in our community experience the love of Christ.”</p>
