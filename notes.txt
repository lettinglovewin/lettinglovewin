The compelling story of a British Muslim who fought against abuse, racism and disillusionment to find God's unconditional love. Rejected by his family as an apostate, Fyaz highlights some of the cultural issues facing converts today. Fyaz grew up as a British-born Pakistani in Northern England. His troubled childhood was full of abuse, racism, and a growing disillusionment with Islam. It eventually led him to rock bottom and criminal behaviour. God, however, was purusing Fyaz. Slowly but surely He guided Fyaz to Him largely through the kindness of strangers. When Fyaz finally gave his life to God his family completely rejected him as an apostate, the consequences of which he still lives with today. While still hoping for reconciliation, Fyaz shares his heart for the calling he believes God has given him to help reach the Muslim community with the message that God's love can indeed win.

                <h2>Review by Lord Carey, former Archbishop of Canterbury</h2>
                <p>“This is an inspiring story! Fyaz gives an utterly compelling account of his journey from Islam to Christianity. It is a tragedy that what should be an entirely free and uncontroversial choice has resulted in the loss of his family and exclusion from the Pakistani community. To be an ‘apostate’ is to be shunned, persecuted and even violently attacked. Fyaz highlights the difficulties that face those who convert but, in spite of this, he bravely demonstrates much practical love and care for the Muslim community. In particular, he calls upon the church to evangelise sensitively and lovingly among Muslims in Britain."</p>
