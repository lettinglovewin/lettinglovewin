               <p>I created <a href="http://www.dostana.co.uk/" class="underlinelink">Dostana Ministries</a> for the sake of the persecuted followers of Jesus living in Europe and around the globe. My vision is to bring the good news of Jesus Christ into every Muslim household worldwide. I also want to build a network of Former Muslims focused on a better quality of life, fellowship, and religious freedom In the UK and abroad.</p>
               <p>Objectives...</p>
               <ul class="objectives">
                    <li>Help those fleeing Islam, forced marriages, domestic violence/rape ( incest ) and honor based violence in the UK</li>
                    <li>To Tackle ideas of honor in schools and Mosques. Schools and Imams should play a key role in ending honor-based violence. Children must be taught sexual equality and that violence against women is wrong. To teach children the importance of Article 18 of the Human Rights Act. And that it is wrong to intimidate, threaten or harm those who choose to leave Islam</li>
                    <li>Campaign for equal rights: demand priority action through local councils and police to deal with honor based violence against former Muslims.</li>
                    <li>To establish a Dostana Ministries help line to gather data on the persecution of ex Muslims and monitor police response, to encourage and support police forces to recognize honor based crimes against ex Muslims and train on how to effectively help the victims.</li>
                    <li>Update Churches and other bodies on news of successes, tragedies, campaigns, events and other matters attributable or impacting on our communities in the UK.</li>
                    <li>Hold public events to promote and support fellowship, and raise better awareness of the plight of ex-Muslims and how churches can get involved.</li>
                    <li>Promote better relationships  between the Muslim community and wider Christian organisations.</li>
                    <li>Raise funds to support former Muslims fleeing for their lives in the UK and help relocate them to safe houses and help them to  become part of their local church or other local support network. DOSTANA is geared to help anyone who wants to leave Islam. Whether they turn to Christ or not, to help those in desperate need.</li>
                    <li>To inform and encourage churches on how they can be a family to those fleeing Islam and be a one body as the family of Christ.</li>
